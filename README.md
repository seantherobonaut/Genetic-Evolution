# Genetic-Evolution
This program recreates a study done by Harvard in 1968 to simulate genetic evolution with robots.
A generation of robots randomly moves throughout the board by matching genes to sensor data.
Each generation is improved by breeding the genes of the top peforming 50% robots.
A pattern emerges in each generation of robots getting better and better at collecting batteries.
